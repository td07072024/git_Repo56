Excavations at Kayatha (around 26 km from Ujjain) have revealed Chalcolithic agricultural settlements dating to around 2000 BCE.[10] Chalcolithic sites have also been discovered at other areas around Ujjain, including Nagda, but excavations at Ujjain itself have not revealed any Chalcolithic settlements. Archaeologist H. D. Sankalia theorised that the Chalcolithic settlements at Ujjain were probably destroyed by the Iron Age settlers.[11]

According to Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund, Avanti, whose capital was Ujjain, "was one of the earliest outposts in central India" and showed signs of early incipient urbanisation around 700 BCE.[12] Around 600 BCE, Ujjain emerged as the political, Commercial, and cultural centre of Malwa plateau.[13]

The ancient walled city of Ujjain was located around the Garh Kalika hill on the bank of the river Kshipra, in the present-day suburban areas of the Ujjain city. This city covered an irregular pentagonal area of 0.875 km2. It was surrounded by a 12 m high mud rampart. The archaeological investigations have also indicated the presence of a 45 meter wide and 6.6 m deep moat around the city.[14] According to F. R. Allchin and George Erdosy, these city defences were constructed between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE.[15] Dieter Schlingloff believes that these were built before 600 BCE.[14] This period is characterised by structures made of stone and burnt-brick, tools and weapons made of iron, and black and red burnished ware.[15]

According to the Puranic texts, a branch of the legendary Haihaya dynasty ruled over Ujjain.[16]
